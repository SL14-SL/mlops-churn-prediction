# Monitoring, SLOs and Alerting

## Purpose

The platform monitors three kinds of production risk:

1. operational reliability of the prediction API;
2. statistical quality of the classifier after delayed labels arrive;
3. business quality of the resulting retention decisions.

A fast API can serve a poor model, and a statistically strong model can still
produce uneconomic actions. All three perspectives are therefore required.

## Terminology

- **SLI — Service Level Indicator:** a measured signal such as availability or
  p95 latency.
- **SLO — Service Level Objective:** the desired value for an SLI.
- **Alert:** a condition indicating that an objective is at risk or violated.

SLOs are internal engineering objectives, not contractual guarantees.

## Operational Metrics

FastAPI exposes Prometheus metrics at `/metrics`.

| Signal | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `api_serving_ready` | Whether a complete serving bundle is active |
| `api_request_count_total` | Request volume by path |
| `api_response_status_total` | HTTP behavior by path and status code |
| `api_request_latency_seconds` | Request-duration histogram |
| Prediction traffic | Requests per minute |

Deployment probe requests use a dedicated context marker and should not
contaminate normal prediction-history-based ML monitoring.

## Service Objectives

| Objective | Indicator | Current alert intent |
|---|---|---|
| API availability | `up{job="churn-api"}` | API remains scrapeable |
| Serving readiness | `api_serving_ready` | A complete bundle remains active |
| Prediction reliability | `/predict` 5xx ratio | Server-error rate stays below 1% with sufficient traffic |
| Prediction latency | `/predict` p95 | p95 stays below one second with sufficient traffic |

Client-side 4xx responses are not server failures and are excluded from the 5xx
SLO.

## Alert Rules

The current rules are:

- `ChurnAPIUnavailable`;
- `ChurnServingBundleNotReady`;
- `ChurnPredictionServerErrorRateHigh`;
- `ChurnPredictionLatencyHigh`.

The `for` durations avoid paging on a single scrape failure or a brief startup
transition.

Validate the rules:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  --entrypoint promtool \
  -v "$PWD/monitoring:/etc/prometheus:ro" \
  prom/prometheus:latest \
  check rules /etc/prometheus/alerts.yml
```

Inspect the rules loaded by Prometheus:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:9090/api/v1/rules \
  | jq '.data.groups[].rules[] | {name, state, health}'
```

## Alertmanager

Alertmanager groups, deduplicates and routes alerts. The local receiver accepts
Alertmanager webhooks and optionally forwards them to Slack.

Validate configuration:

```bash
docker compose run --rm \
  --no-deps \
  --entrypoint /bin/amtool \
  alertmanager \
  check-config /etc/alertmanager/alertmanager.yml
```

Check readiness and routing:

```bash
curl -fsS http://localhost:9093/-/ready
curl -s http://localhost:9090/api/v1/alertmanagers | jq .
```

When `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` is empty, the receiver logs that external delivery was
skipped. This is expected and does not indicate failure between Prometheus,
Alertmanager and the receiver.

## Grafana SLO Dashboard

The provisioned dashboard presents:

- serving readiness;
- prediction availability;
- p95 prediction latency;
- request traffic;
- prediction 5xx rate;
- p50, p95 and p99 latency.

`No data` does not automatically mean failure. Rate and histogram expressions
need matching counters and enough observations in the selected lookback window.

## ML Quality Monitoring

### Runtime data quality

Each prediction batch records:

- row count;
- missing rates by input field;
- unseen categories;
- overall quality status;
- validation failures where applicable.

### Feature drift

Selected production inputs are compared with reference distributions. Drift
must persist across configured windows before it contributes to retraining.

### Delayed-label performance

Churn outcomes arrive after predictions have already been served. Once labels
are released and joined to prediction history, the platform computes rolling
classification metrics such as:

- F1 score;
- recall;
- ROC AUC;
- Brier score;
- sample count and class balance.

An undefined metric caused by a one-class window is recorded as insufficient
evidence rather than silently treated as model degradation.

The lifecycle dashboard reports rolling classification performance over the
latest 150 released labels. Retraining executions and successful Champion
promotions are displayed as separate event types because a completed training
run does not necessarily replace the active model.

### Business monitoring

The Streamlit dashboard separates current inference activity from outcomes
that require released labels.

Prediction and action monitoring covers:

- prediction volume and average churn risk;
- share of predictions above the active decision threshold;
- active decision threshold;
- retention-action volume and distribution.

Labeled business outcomes cover:

- expected net profit;
- gross saved value;
- intervention costs;
- label-based simulated net profit;
- expected and simulated profit per labeled action.

The relationship between the realized business metrics is:

```text
simulated gross saved value - intervention costs = simulated net profit
```

The policy-analysis view additionally shows how increasing the minimum expected
profit required per action changes the selected action volume and simulated
portfolio profit.

Business outcomes use assumed intervention uplift, not measured treatment
effects. Offline analysis uses a common policy implementation for profit curves
and uplift sensitivity. Minimum-profit filtering is a scenario comparison, not
evidence of realized campaign revenue.

## Dashboard Roles

| Dashboard | Primary purpose |
|---|---|
| Grafana | Live API reliability and SLO status |
| Streamlit | Model quality, delayed labels and business decisions |

The dashboard screenshots use local controlled experiment data. Terraform
does not provision the Streamlit or Grafana stack in Google Cloud. Choose a
lookback window containing prediction traffic; an empty short window does not
establish an outage.

## Verification Commands

```bash
curl -fsS http://localhost:8000/readyz | jq .

curl -fsS http://localhost:8000/metrics \
  | grep -A2 api_serving_ready

curl -sG \
  --data-urlencode 'query=api_serving_ready' \
  http://localhost:9090/api/v1/query \
  | jq .
```

## Initial Incident Response

| Alert | First checks |
|---|---|
| API unavailable | Container/Cloud Run state, `/livez`, application logs |
| Bundle not ready | `/readyz`, release pointer, checksums, MLflow/GCS access |
| High 5xx rate | Request samples, prediction exceptions, active release |
| High latency | Traffic, batch size, p95/p99 trend, CPU/memory and timing stages |

If an incident begins immediately after release activation, compare the current
release ID with the previous release and use the tested rollback procedure.
