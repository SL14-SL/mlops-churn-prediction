# System Architecture

## Purpose

This document describes the runtime components, ownership boundaries and data
flows of the customer-churn platform. Training, model selection, release
publication and online serving are separated so they can be tested and operated
independently.

## Internal Code Boundaries

| Layer | Main modules | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| Flow orchestration | `flows/training_flow.py`, `flows/auto_retrain_flow.py` | Coordinate lifecycle steps |
| Deployment orchestration | `flows/deployment_flow.py`, `flows/tasks/serving_tasks.py` | Publish, reload, verify and roll back releases |
| HTTP transport | `src/mlops_churn_prediction/api/app.py`, `src/mlops_churn_prediction/api/schema.py` | Endpoints, authentication and response contracts |
| API services | `src/mlops_churn_prediction/api/services.py` | Shared pipeline invocation and business-result helpers |
| Inference | `src/mlops_churn_prediction/inference/pipeline.py`, `src/mlops_churn_prediction/inference/adapters.py` | Feature alignment and model execution |
| Decisioning | `src/mlops_churn_prediction/inference/decision.py` | Retention action and expected-value policy |
| Serving state | `src/mlops_churn_prediction/inference/serving_bundle.py`, `src/mlops_churn_prediction/inference/model_manager.py` | Load and validate one complete bundle |
| Release lifecycle | `src/mlops_churn_prediction/inference/releases/` | Manifests, storage, publication and active-pointer operations |
| Training | `src/mlops_churn_prediction/training/` | Training, evaluation, explainability and registration |
| Monitoring | `src/mlops_churn_prediction/monitoring/` | Data quality, drift, delayed labels, costs and retraining signals |
| Storage | `src/mlops_churn_prediction/storage/` | Local and cloud filesystem operations |


## Training and Promotion Flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["Prepare and snapshot data"] --> B["Train candidate"]
    B --> C["Recent-production evaluation"]
    C --> D{"Recent gates pass?"}
    D -->|No| E["Keep current Champion"]
    D -->|Yes| F["Reference safety evaluation"]
    F --> G{"Safety gates pass?"}
    G -->|No| E
    G -->|Yes| H["Register and assign Champion"]
    H --> I["Publish immutable release"]
    I --> J["Reload and verify API"]
```
Recent labeled production data is the primary promotion dataset when available.
The policy optimizes recent business value while enforcing configurable
non-regression tolerances for classification quality. Reference validation is a
separate safety layer protecting the original data distribution.

Retraining execution and Champion promotion are intentionally separate
lifecycle events.

`--force` bypasses the pre-training decision to skip a run. It does not bypass
the Champion/challenger promotion policy. A fresh registry requires the
explicit `--bootstrap` path.

## Serving Architecture

MLflow and serving-release storage have different responsibilities:

- MLflow is the source of truth for experiments and registered model versions.
- A serving release fixes the exact numeric model version, feature schema,
  decision threshold and prediction probe.
- The active pointer selects one complete release.
- The API replaces its in-memory bundle only after the new bundle has loaded
  and validated successfully.

This prevents mixed states such as a new model with an old schema or an updated
decision threshold with stale model metadata.

The `/readyz`, `/health`, `/metrics` and prediction routes all reflect the same
active bundle. A failed reload leaves the previous bundle available.

## Prediction and Decision Flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["Authenticated request"] --> B["Schema and data-quality validation"]
    B --> C["Feature engineering"]
    C --> D["Feature-schema alignment"]
    D --> E["Churn probability"]
    E --> F["Customer-value estimate"]
    F --> G["Retention decision"]
    G --> H["Response and prediction log"]
```

Customer identifiers are retained for response and monitoring lineage but are
not used as predictive model features.

## Environment Topology

### Local development

Docker Compose starts:

- FastAPI;
- PostgreSQL;
- MLflow;
- Prefect server;
- Prometheus;
- Grafana;
- Alertmanager and the local alert receiver.

The Streamlit dashboard can also be exposed by the project stack. Local runtime
directories hold data, models, monitoring output and serving releases.

### Google Cloud production

Terraform provisions the environment's API and MLflow platform:

- Cloud Run services named `mlops-churn-prediction-<environment>-api` and
  `mlops-churn-prediction-<environment>-mlflow`;
- Cloud SQL PostgreSQL for persistent MLflow metadata;
- Artifact Registry for both container images;
- GCS for datasets, release manifests, schemas and MLflow model artifacts;
- Secret Manager for the API key and MLflow database password;
- dedicated API, MLflow and training service accounts;
- GitHub Actions with Workload Identity Federation.

MLflow is private. The API runtime and authorized training identity invoke it
with renewable identity tokens. MLflow connects to Cloud SQL through the
Cloud SQL connection and accesses its GCS artifacts using its runtime identity.
The API needs MLflow during bundle loading, not for every prediction request.

Prefect Cloud remains an external orchestration service. Streamlit, Prometheus,
Grafana and Alertmanager screenshots show the local Compose stack; they are
not provisioned by the cloud deployment module.

The demonstrated cloud deployment was verified and torn down on 6 October
2026. The screenshots document that run rather than a currently live service.

## Trust Boundaries

| Boundary | Control |
|---|---|
| Client to API | API key and Pydantic request validation |
| GitHub Actions to GCP | Workload Identity Federation |
| API/training process to GCS | Service account and bucket IAM |
| API/training process to MLflow | Cloud Run invoker IAM and renewable identity tokens |
| Release activation | Manifest validation, path containment and checksums |
| Model replacement | Load-before-swap bundle activation |
| Application deployment workflow | Cloud Run service readiness |
| Serving release deployment | Readiness and semantic prediction verification |
| Failed deployment | Active-pointer restoration and reload |

## Reusable and Domain-Specific Layers

Reusable infrastructure includes orchestration, registry integration, serving
releases, health checks, monitoring, rollback, CI/CD and Terraform.

Churn-specific code includes the request fields, classification metrics,
decision threshold, customer-value estimation, retention actions, delayed-label
evaluation and promotion thresholds. These layers are deliberately isolated
from the reusable operational architecture.
